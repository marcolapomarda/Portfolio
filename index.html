            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hi! I'm Marco, Since high school I have been passionate about Tech and Digital, especially regarding Web and Front End development.</p>
            <p>I have been working in the IT sector for almost 4 years now. 
                My journey started right after my high school graduation, I was recruited by a multinational Digital Services company and I had an initial Internship period where I learnt the fundamentals of Web Development.</p>
            <p>Even though I trained in Web Development, I was placed in a Help Desk project which led me to learn new technologies and working approaches. This project took me busy full time for more than 3 years.</p>
            <p><i>But</i> in June 2022 I decided to get back to learn Web Development, especially regarding Front-End - Because that's what I like and the career path I want to pursuit - so in this Portfolio you'll find all the references to my projects and, if you're interested to know more about me, a dedicated section to contact me.</p>

        <h4>Exercises Repository</h4>
        <p>Since June 2022 I'm enrolled in an online course held by <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/catalog" target="_blank">Codecademy</a> which aims to form a Front-End Engineer. I pushed on a GitHub remote repository all the exercises and small projects developed during this course.</p>

        <h4>First deploy with GitHub Pages</h4>
        <p>The first project that I deployed, and it's accessible thanks to GitHub Pages hosting, is a static HTML-CSS web page, it's essentially an exercise for the use of the CSS FlexBox and Grid dispaly properties (here's the <a href="https://github.com/marcolapomarda/marcolapomarda.github.io/tree/main/docs" target="_blank">source code</a>).</p>
